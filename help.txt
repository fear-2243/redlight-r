Hello there, user! Since you're here, 
it probably means you're either new to nanoFM or maybe you want to refresh your memory.
These are the commands you'll use in nanoFM, and by the way, we assume you know what you're doing... 
You must make sure to enter only one character when typing the command, and you should also know that the file you want to run exists, 
and the directory where you want to save it is valid... 
Pay attention to typing the names correctly with the required case. 
If you enter an uppercase letter instead of lowercase, we won’t find the file. 
You also need to include the file extension if it has one. If you're trying to run an .exe file, 
make sure to include the extension as well... 
and Thank you. At least, you should have used a Linux distribution before or know its basics... 
Remember, this is Linux, not Windows, and we can't simplify it further. Also, your device should be relatively weak since you're using Nano Linux, 
but maybe you have a powerful device and you want to get the most out of its performance, 
which is really great by the way. I
'd like to thank you for using Nano Linux. Remember, 
Nano Linux is supported by people like you who give me the motivation to continue developing this system further... 
This way, we'll allow anyone, no matter how weak their hardware is, to use the computer and enjoy it with us until their financial situation improves... 
Nano doesn't eat up your CPU and doesn't limit your system’s performance, unlike others... We mean Microsoft, of course. Good luck using Nano Linux!
